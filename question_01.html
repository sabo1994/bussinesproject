		<h1>QUESTION 1</h1>

		<div>
		<p id="question">Andy is a daredevil biker in his mid twenties. He sees an attractive girl walk by and he immediately wants to show off his skills by biking over a stranger's car while doing a 360 in an area where NO BIKING is allowed. However, because he got so nervous he screws up and shatters the windshield. Is Andy liable for damages?
